# Blender-3.0-Alpha
This is the alpha version of the Blender 3.0 version, with a new rendering engine, Cycles X and has better performance improvements. This is the alpha version though so DO NOT create any long term projects as this is not the final build and may have bugs.
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
This build is taken from "https://builder.blender.org/download/daily/" and visit there fore more updates if you want it directly from Blender. This repo will be updates when the new version of Blender comes out this December(unless there is a delay).

Happy Blendering(basically a word I made up for Blender and rendering)!
